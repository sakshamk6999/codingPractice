Jatin is shopping for groceries in a super mart.
There's an offer in the mall in which if the total purchase done by a customer is a multiple of a number m,
then the customer will get a massive cashback !
There's a condition though, the customer should buy exactly n items (Note that the customer can buy the same product
multiple times)
There are l different types of products available for purchase (Each category has an infinite amount of products),
the cost of all the l items is provided.
Jatin is also a geek and wonders how many possible ways are there to purchase items in such a way that he could get the
cashback
Help him find the number of ways possible to make the purchase !
As this number can be large, you need to print the answer modulo 1000000007.

INPUT

The first line of input contains integers n, m, and l.
The second line of the input contains l spaced integers denoting the cost of each product type.

OUTPUT

You have to print one line, the number of ways to purchase the items in order to get the cashback, modulo 1000000007.

CONSTRAINTS
1 <= n <= 1e5
1 <= m <= 10
1 <= l <= 1e5
1 <= li <= 1e9
